# Mocks

This folder contains mock data and mock functions used in the tests. Mocks are used to isolate the code under test from external dependencies.

## Usefulness of Mocks

Mocks are essential for:
- **Isolating Tests**: Preventing external dependencies from affecting test results by simulating their behavior.
- **Testing Specific Scenarios**: Simulating specific responses from external services to test particular cases.
- **Improving Test Speed**: Avoiding calls to real services that can be slow or costly.

Use mocks to control the test environment and test scenarios that are difficult to reproduce with real data.
