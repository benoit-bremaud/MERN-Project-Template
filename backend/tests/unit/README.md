# Unit Tests

This folder contains the unit tests for the application. Unit tests check the smallest parts of your code, such as individual functions or components, in isolation.

## Importance of Unit Tests

Unit tests are crucial for:
- **Validating Individual Functions**: Ensuring each function performs as expected.
- **Bug Detection**: Identifying errors in isolated features before they affect other parts of the code.
- **Facilitating Refactoring**: Allowing code modifications with the confidence that basic functionalities still work.

Each test file here should focus on a single unit of code, like a function or a component.
