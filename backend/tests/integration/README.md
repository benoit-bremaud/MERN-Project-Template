# Integration Tests

This folder contains the integration tests for the application. Integration tests check how different parts of the application work together.

## Importance of Integration Tests

Integration tests are essential for:
- **Verifying Component Interactions**: Ensuring that modules or services interact correctly.
- **Testing APIs and Communication**: Validating that API calls return the correct data and data flows as expected.
- **Identifying Integration Issues**: Discovering problems that may not be visible in unit tests.

Use these tests to verify critical integrations and key interaction points in the application.
