# Utils

This folder contains utilities and helpers used in the tests. These files help simplify and standardize test configurations and behaviors.

## Types of Utilities

- **Setup and Teardown Functions**: Functions to set up and clean up the test environment.
- **Test Data Generators**: Tools to create consistent and reproducible test data.
- **Common Helpers**: Shared functions that can be reused across multiple tests to avoid code duplication.

These utilities help keep the test code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and facilitate maintenance.
