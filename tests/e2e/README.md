# End-to-End Tests

This folder contains the end-to-end (E2E) tests for the application. E2E tests simulate user behavior to check the application as a whole.

## Importance of End-to-End Tests

E2E tests are important for:
- **Simulating Real Scenarios**: Testing the application as a final user would, interacting with the UI.
- **Verifying User Flows**: Ensuring user journeys work as intended, from navigation to data processing.
- **Detecting Production Bugs**: Identifying issues that might occur in a real environment, involving all application layers.

These tests are generally longer to run and should be used to validate critical features in production.
